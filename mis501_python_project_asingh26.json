    "q4.1": "I looked at a few things to confirm. First skimming over the teams list, all the team names were familiar. There were 6 team names that were unusual (EAST, WEST, SOUTH, NORTH, American, and National). They were all in week one and were playing one another which made me think they could be a non-season all-star game so I chose to remove those 3 games since the focus seems to be the college football season games. I checked to see if there were duplicate games but there weren't any. The number of games (871) and teams (206) also appears to be reasonable as I assume some of the non-conference games a FBS school plays will be against non-FBS opponents who only appear once in the dataset and some smaller schools may not always have their game on ESPN so that may explain why the ratio of games to teams is lower than the actual number of games a team plays in a season.",

Alabama made 18 and missed 8 field goals which is better than a school like South Carolina who only made 15 but missed 13. In the regular season, Alabama's ratio was 2.25 which is less than the average ratio which was 3.22 though that may include some teams that were only represented in the list once because they are a lower level school. According to the data, Alabama did miss more often than the average school.",
